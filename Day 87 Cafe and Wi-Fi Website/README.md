<h1> Cafe and Wifi Website </h1>
<br>
<br>
<h4> On day 66, we create an API that serves data on cafes with wifi and good coffee. In this project, we are going to use the data from that project to build a fully-fledged website to display the information.
<br>
This assignment includes an SQLite database called cafes.db that lists all the cafe data.
<br>
Using this database and what you learned about REST APIs and web development, create a website that uses this data. It should display the cafes, but it could also allow people to add new cafes or delete cafes.</h4>
